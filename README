Infos:
---------------------
The Python programs were developed in Debian testing with the excellent scientific IDE Spyder
The following Packages are requirements to run the scripts.
The reedsolomon library as an external library has to be compiled.


Requirements:
----------------------
Packages when using Debian testing/Ubuntu:
- python (2.6.x)
- python-crypto (2.1.0)
- python-scipy (0.7.2)
- python-matplotlib (0.99.3)
- python-dev (2.6.x) (to install reedsolomon-0.1)
- python-setuptools (0.6.14) (to install reedsolomon-0.1)
- python-twisted-core (10.1.0)
- python-gst0.10 (0.10.19)
- ntpdate (for time synchronization)

reedsolomon-0.1:
Compile and install:
- change into the directory of reedsolomon library
- python setup.py build
- as root:
  python setup.py install


Using synchronized microphone recording in implementation
----------------------
You have to use an operating system with GStreamer libraries, to get this working, because it is based on pythons Gstreamer wrapper.
In the files imlementation_server.py and implementation_client.py, the variables self.recording_use_file has
to be changed to False on initialization of the Pairing Object to use the microphones.

IMPORTANT:
- To get the time synchronization of the recordings right, set your operating systems NTP Server to the same server, like ptbtime1.ptb.de
- Disable all other inputs or microphones on your system
- Make Microphones approximatly the same recording volume in ALSA, that produces good results
- Before starting, do
  * sudo killall ntpd
  * sudo ntpdate -d ptbtime1.ptb.de
  * you can do ntpdate various times
