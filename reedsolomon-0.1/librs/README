This package implements a general purpose Reed-Solomon encoding and decoding
facility. See the rs.3 man page for details.

To install, simply do the following after extracting this tarball into
an empty directory:

./configure
make
make install

The command "make test" runs a battery of encode/decode tests using a
variety of RS codes using random data and random errors. Each test
should pass with an "OK"; if any fail, please let me know so I can
track down the problem.

Under Mac OS X, "make test" is known to fail on the last test
(65535,65503).  This is nothing serious. Apparently that system has a
tighter limit on stack space than the typical Linux system, but this
particular Reed-Solomon code is far larger than anything you're likely
to use in practice anyway.
